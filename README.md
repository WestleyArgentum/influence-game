#### This is a (slightly cynical) game about influence in Congress

The influence wielded by special interests as a result of the way campaigns are financed in the US has a profoundly negative impact on civic participation.

Unfortunately, campaign finance is also a complicated system that’s difficult to illustrate with words alone. While broad trends clearly show that large doners have the attention of our lawmakers, rarely can we look at an individual vote and cry “quid pro quo”.

We believe a better way to engage people is to build a lobbying-themed fantasy football-like game about influence in Congress.

In this game, players will build teams out of lobbyists and play through “seasons” of Congress. “Games” will be actions taken by Congress on bills, encouraging players to be politically active and aware.
